# W209 Data Visualization - Spring 2016

This class focused on javascript wrt data visualization, especially leveraging d3.

My class project encompassed development of a web app to provide a user in New York City a real-time estimate of different commute options keying off of a starting and stopping address and leveraging data provided by Nate Silver on taxicab destinations and fares.

My part of the project involved leveraging geocode functions (part of the ggmap package in R) to determine and annotate coordinate and route information on our map using data accessed from our RedShift RDB. 

[ROUTR.NYC Visualizing taxicab routes and fares](./DATASCI%20W209%20-%20NYC%20Transit%20-%20RoutR%20-%20%5BFinal%5D%20-%20Presentation.pdf)
