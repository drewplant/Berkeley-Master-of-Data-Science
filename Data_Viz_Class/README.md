# W209 Data Visualization - Spring 2016

This class devoted considerable time to focusing on javascript wrt data visualization, especially leveraging d3.

My class project encompassed development of a web app to provide a user in New York City a real-time estimate of different commute options keying off of a starting and stopping address and leveraging data provided by Nate Silver on taxicab destinations and fares.

[ROUTR.NYC Visualizing taxicab routes and fares](./DATASCI%20W209%20-%20NYC%20Transit%20-%20RoutR%20-%20%5BFinal%5D%20-%20Presentation.pdf)
