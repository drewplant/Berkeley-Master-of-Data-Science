# 266 Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning Project - Fall 2016

This class dealt with traditional language models (Knesser-Ney smoothing models, constituency parsing, parts-of-speech modeling, dependency parsing, CYK and Viterbi algorithms for POS modeling) as well as neural-net based models (RNN's, LSTM RNN's, CNN's.)

My project focused on use of an LSTM RNN to categorize student essay words into grammatical errors.

The paper is here:  [Essay Scoring with Grammatical Error Detection](./Essay Scoring with Grammatical Error Detection.pdf)

I'm also currently a teaching assistant for the class!
