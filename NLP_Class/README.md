# W266 Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning - Fall 2016

This class dealt with traditional language models (Knesser-Ney smoothing models, constituency parsing, parts-of-speech modeling, dependency parsing, CYK and Viterbi algorithms for POS modeling) as well as neural-net based models (RNN's, LSTM RNN's, CNN's.)

My project focused on use of an LSTM RNN to analyze essays of non-native-English-speaking students for the purpose of identifying grammatical errors.

The paper is here:  [Essay Scoring with Grammatical Error Detection](./EssayScoringwithGrammaticalErrorDetection.pdf)

I'm also currently a teaching assistant for the class!
